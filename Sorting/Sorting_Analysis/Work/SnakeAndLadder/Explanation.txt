Certainly, here's an explanation of the Snakes and Ladders game modeling and the tasks to be solved, followed by the code.

### Explanation:

**Game Modeling:**

1. We model the Snakes and Ladders game as a graph where each square on the board is a node, and edges represent possible moves from each square.
2. This graph is directed because you can only move in one direction, either up the ladder or down the snake.
3. The graph is implicitly weighted, as each move may require a different number of dice rolls.

**ADT Functions:**

- We define two important ADT (Abstract Data Type) functions:
    1. `createGraph`: This function creates a graph representation of the board, considering snakes and ladders as edges. It returns an adjacency list.
    2. `getNeighbors`: This function returns the neighbors of a given position on the board, representing possible moves.

**Task 1: Verify Board Conditions**

**Task 1.1: Check if There's a Path to Goal:**

- We use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to check if there's a path to the goal from the start position. This ensures that the game can be completed.

**Task 1.2: Check for Snake and Ladder Overlaps:**

- We ensure that there are no overlapping snakes or ladders on the same square. If multiple snakes/ladders start or end at the same position, it's considered invalid.

**Task 1.3: Check for Cycles:**

- We check if the board has any cycles. Cycles would indicate that there's no way to reach the goal. We use a topological sort-based approach for this check.

**Task 1.4: Check for Direct Path from Start to End:**

- We verify that there is no direct path (ladder) from the start position to the destination. Having a ladder from start to end would make the game trivial.

### Code:

Here's the code following the explanations:
