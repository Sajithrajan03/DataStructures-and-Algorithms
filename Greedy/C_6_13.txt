This algorithm performs a BFS from each station and records all stations that can be reached within 4 links or fewer. It uses a dictionary to store the reachable stations for each station.

 

Initialize an empty dictionary reachable to store the reachable stations for each station.
Iterate through each station in the graph.
For each station, perform a BFS to explore the network, keeping track of the visited stations and the distance from the current station.
If the distance exceeds 4, skip further exploration from that station.
Add the reachable stations to the reachable dictionary for the current station.
Repeat the process for all stations in the network.
Finally, print the reachable stations for each station.
The algorithm efficiently computes the set of stations that each station can reach using no more than 4 links in the network represented by the given graph.
